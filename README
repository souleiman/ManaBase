ManaBase will be used as a means of DataBase to keep track of my previous project also known as ManaBot.

After it's fourth expansion, I've finally decided to make the next expansion of the project to be open source.

Unfortunately, due to the unavailable or lack of an existence of a Database, *glares at wizard*
I decided to make one as a purpose to learn SQL, in this project I will be using SQLite.

I do not plan to leave this as a Magic the Gathering Database, but I do plan on having it co-exist with YU-GI-OH as
well.

If you have suggestion or you are interested in following with the development of this project. You can join the IRC
the current Database is being used at irc.wyvernirc.net at #mtg and look for Spock.
